                <p>
					<Strong>Name:</Strong> Hamilton The Wihtikow
					<br />
					<Strong>Gender:</Strong> Male
					<br />
					<Strong>Species:</Strong> ??? (It’s just called a Wihtikow, but nobody 
					knows what it really is. So the town just called it a Wihtikow.)
					<br />
					<Strong>Age:</Strong> 152
					<br />
					<Strong>Bio:</Strong> “The terror of the forest, the Wihtikow, a enigmatic 
					creature of unknown origin. It wanders forests in search of… who know what, 
					but the most important thing is that it must be slain! Hamilton, as we 
					named it,  is a menace to the humble town of Woodhage! It shall be put 
					down by the guns and blades of the victims it terrorized day and night!”- 
					Mayor Bernard of Woodhage.
					<br />
					<Strong>Personality:</Strong> “Uh… it uhm… it likes to cause trouble we 
					guess? And… oh! It loves to eat anything that lives or moves! Even eats 
					trees and water! Or at least tries to eat water.”- Henry
					<br />
					<Strong>Appearance:</Strong> “Well… how do I even start to describe this. 
					The reports are mixed, but here’s what I can gather; it is a feral boar, 
					mammoth, moose, bear, elk, beaver, badger, ape thing. Sounds weird 
					doesn’t it? That’s why we called it a Wihtikow.”- Johnny  
					<br />
					<Strong>Talents/Skills:</Strong> “No matter how many spears, arrows, 
					bullets, and dynamite we throw at it… it never seems to die! We’ve seen 
					it bleed, but it’s never gone down! Best we’ve done is make it leave us 
					alone for a bit! And that’s not to mention it’s immense strength! It 
					flipped the Greenman family’s whole coach 100 feet in the air!” - Margie
					<br />
					<Strong>Strengths:</Strong> “It loves the night… and winter… and oh boy 
					does it love the cold, nearly killed me on a hunting trip after a 
					blizzard!” - Robby
					<br />
					<Strong>Weaknesses:</Strong> “THE FIRE, THE LIGHT!!! IT KEEPS THE 
					WIHTIKOW AWAY!!!” - Angus
					<br />
					<Strong>dating:</Strong> “I swear that things trying to mate with my 
					cattle! Oh, but I won’t let it! I keep one eye open every night with 
					a shotgun under my pillow. So when it comes… I’ll be waiting for it!” 
					- Gary
